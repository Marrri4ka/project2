              <p>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive
                web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts,
              entering information, and interacting with dynamic content,
              there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular
              because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified
            many of the common tasks associated with building web applications.
              It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are
                   looking to build their product quickly.
Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example,
 Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'l
 l see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like
 frameworks including </p>

            <div class = "panel-body">
              <p>PHP is by far the most popular backend language today, with
                 80 percent of websites utilizing it 'server-side'. It is perhaps
                 best known for it's use in content management systems like Wordpress,
                Drupal, and Joomla. But the versatility of the language and the
                frameworks it powers make employment options numerous and diverse.
                If you're keen to work for a fast paced agency that builds websites
                 for lots of clients, or maintain the security and stability of
                  a huge complex of government websites, or if you like the idea
              of building out small sites for brands, businesses, and organizations - In any of these cases, PHP would be a great way to go.</p>

              <p>Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal
                 is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all
                 programming languages, and it's used in everything from for
                  high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces.
                 Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and
                  is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand
                  language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level
                  company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance
                  applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</p>

              <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of
                Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic
                 choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different
                  types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.</p>

              <p>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often
               for building internal software. Because it's been around for a
               long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the
              most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been
              going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open
              sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it
              to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best
              features of other languages. If you like the idea of
              working for a larger company on business software, C# is
                a great choice.</p>
